# Azure MFA Project â€“ karangoyal134@gmail.com

This project demonstrates the configuration and testing of **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** using a personal Azure account, without the use of Microsoft Entra ID Governance (P1) license. It includes enabling and managing user MFA settings, monitoring authentication methods, and validating sign-ins with MFA prompts.

## Project Overview

- Configure per-user MFA
- Set up and test multiple MFA methods (Authenticator App, SMS, Phone)
- Manage user authentication settings
- Monitor sign-in activity and MFA usage
- Note: Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) setup blocked due to license limitations
